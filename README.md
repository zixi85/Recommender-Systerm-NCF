# Neural Collaborative Filtering on MovieLens 1M

This repository implements Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) modelsâ€”GMF, MLP, and NeuMFâ€”on the MovieLens 1M dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and ablation studies to analyze the effects of key architectural and hyperparameter choices.

## File Descriptions

| File               | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `data_load.py`     | Loads and preprocesses the MovieLens 1M dataset. Handles data splitting and negative sampling. |
| `evaluation_f1.py` | Computes F1 score for evaluating the effect of different rating thresholds. |
| `evaluation.py`    | Calculates NDCG@10 and Recall@10 for recommendation performance evaluation. |
| `factors.py`       | Ablation experiment on the impact of predictive factor size (latent dimension). |
| `layers.py`        | Ablation experiment on the number of hidden layers in the MLP architecture. |
| `model.py`         | Compares GMF, MLP, and NeuMF models under unified training settings. |
| `GMF.py`           | Defines the standalone GMF model architecture. |
| `MLP.py`           | Defines the standalone MLP model architecture. |
| `NeuMF.py`         | Defines the full NeuMF model combining GMF and MLP components. |
| `negsample.py`     | Tests the effect of different negative sampling rates on performance. |
| `pre_train.py`     | Compares NeuMF with and without pre-training using saved GMF and MLP weights. |
| `threshold.py`     | Evaluates model performance under different rating threshold settings (e.g., 3 vs. 4). |

## Pre-trained Model Files

- `gmf_best.pth`: Trained GMF model weights for pre-training NeuMF  
- `mlp_best.pth`: Trained MLP model weights for pre-training NeuMF  

These files are automatically loaded in `pre_train.py` when comparing pre-trained vs. non-pretrained NeuMF models.

## Running the Code

1. **Download** the [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/).
2. **Place** the `ratings.dat` file into the root directory of this project.
3. **Run** any of the executable scripts below to train models and output evaluation results.

## Runnable Experiment Scripts

Each of the following scripts runs a complete experiment and prints performance metrics upon completion:

- `factors.py` â€” Predictive factor ablation  
- `layers.py` â€” Hidden layer depth ablation  
- `model.py` â€” GMF vs. MLP vs. NeuMF  
- `negsample.py` â€” Negative sampling analysis  
- `pre_train.py` â€” Pre-training vs. no pre-training (loads `gmf_best.pth` and `mlp_best.pth`)  
- `threshold.py` â€” Threshold setting comparison

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Recall@10**: Measures how many relevant items are successfully recommended.
- **NDCG@10**: Evaluates the ranking quality of recommended items.
- **F1 Score**: Used for comparing label quality under different threshold settings.

## Notes

- All models use Kaiming initialization and a learning rate scheduler for better convergence.
- Training curves are smoothed for visualization; original data points are also plotted.
- Evaluation results are printed after training; you may redirect outputs as needed.
